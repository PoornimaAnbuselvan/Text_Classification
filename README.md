# Text_Classification
This project classifies consumer complaints into four categories: Credit reporting, Debt collection, Consumer Loan, and Mortgage. Using text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, TF-IDF) and models like Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, and SVM, the system predicts complaint types with high accuracy.
